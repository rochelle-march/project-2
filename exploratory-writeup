1. My project is about exploring where ICT (information communications technology) is most correlated with sustainable development (measured using the Sustainable Development Goals indicators), which can point to areas where it can be further leveraged around the world, or new areas to consider applying ICT solutions to support sustainable development. The problem I am solving is two-fold: 1.) Better understanding the relationship between ICT and sustainable development, and 2.) Helping to prioritize where to invest in ICT to support sustainable development. 

I will be predicting a continuous variable, which will be the correlation (measured by R-squared) between ICT variables and sustainable development variables. Given areas of sustainable development where ICT is most correlated, I can predict where it may be the most impactful in the future in areas where ICT has not been well-developed (e.g., developing countries,) and potentially predict where sustainable development could be accelerated through the use of ICT (e.g., developed countries where ICT is not being leveraged for sustainability, but mostly for profit motives. For example, in the U.S. there is large development of ICT to run streaming videos rather than develop remote diagnostics for health problems such as sudden-infant-death syndrome where the US performs below even developing countries).  

I think this could have a positive impact, particularly to ICT and technology companies who are seeking contribution to the SDGs and to sustainable development priorities, and to sustainability practicioners, such as UN members, who are developing coalitions and initiatives to help countries achieve the SDGs by 2030. The analysis will add to an already roboust amount of information to help both parties prioritize which ICT initiatives to deploy on which sustainability objectives (e.g., health, education, clean water, etc.).

I think the biggest impact will come from areas where ICT has already been widely used - such as in healthcare, education and industrialization. I also predict that GDP will play a large role in the correlation (weathier nations tend to be more sustainable and have more developed ICT infrastructure), but will not be the most impactful. If I can, I'd like to control for GDP in order to explore this more.
